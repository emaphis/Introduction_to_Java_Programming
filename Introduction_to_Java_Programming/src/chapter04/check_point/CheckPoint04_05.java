    // 4.5.1 If you run Listing 4.3 GuessBirthday.java with input 1 for Set1, Set3, and Set4 and
    //       0 for Set2 and Set5, what will be the birthday?
    // a. Your birthday is 13!

    // 4.5.2 If you enter a lowercase letter such as b, the program in Listing 4.4 displays B is 11.
    //       Revise the code as to display b is 11.
    // The line
    // System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit "
    //            +  ch  + " is " + value);
    // changes to:
    // System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit "
    //            + hexString + " is " + value);

    // 4.5.3 What would be wrong if lines 6 and 7 are in Listing 4.5 replaced by the following
    //       code?
    //  String lottery = "" + (int)(Math.random() * 100);
    // a. You would lose the first digit if it's '0'.
