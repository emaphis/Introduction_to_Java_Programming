/*
 * Exercise 2.10
 *  .(Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
 *   to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
 *   should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
 *   and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 *
 *     Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 *
 *   where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in
 *   degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules
