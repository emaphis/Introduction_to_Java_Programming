/*
 * Exercise 2.12
 *  .(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 *   speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 *  take off using the following formula:
 *
 *   length = (v * v)  / (2 * a)
 *
 *  Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and
 *  the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), then, displays the minimum
 *  runway length.
