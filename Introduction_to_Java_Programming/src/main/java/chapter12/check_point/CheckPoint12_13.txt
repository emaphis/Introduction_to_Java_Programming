Check Point 12.13 -  Case Study: Web Crawler


12.13.1 Before a URL is added to listOfPendingURLs, line 25 checks whether it has been 
        traversed. Is it possible that listOfPendingURLs contains duplicate URLs? If so, 
        give an example.
a- Yes. A page could appear on more than one other page and be deleted from the list of
   Taversed URL's


12.13.2 Simplify the code in lines 20-28 as follows: 1. Delete lines 20 and 28;
        2. Add an addiï¿¾tional condition !listOfPendingURLs.contains(s) to the
        if statement in line 25. 
        Write the complete new code for the while loop in lines 17-29.
        Does this revision work?
