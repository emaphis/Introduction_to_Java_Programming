Check Point 12.5 - The finally Clause


12.5.1 Suppose you run the following code:

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception2 {
    m();
    statement7;
}

public static void m() {
    try {
        statement1;
        statement2;
        statement3;
    }
    catch (Exception1 ex1) {
        statement4;
    }
    finally {
        statement5;
    }
    statement6;
}

Answer the following questions:
a. If no exception occurs, which statements are executed?
a-  statement1;
    statement2;
    statement3;
    statement5;
    statement6;
    statement7;

b. If statement2 throws an exception of type Exception1, which statements are
   executed?
b-  statement1;
    statement2;
    statement4;
    statement5;
    statement6;
    statement7;

c. If statement2 throws an exception of type Exception2, which statements are
   executed?
c-  statement1;
    statement2;
    statement5;

d. If statement2 throws an exception that is neither Exception1 nor Exception2, which
   statements are executed?
d-  statement1;
    statement2;
    statement5;


2.5.2 Suppose you run the following code:

  }
}

public static void m() {
  try {
    statement1;
    statement2;
    statement3;
  }
  catch (Exception1 ex1) {
    statement4;
  }
  finally {
