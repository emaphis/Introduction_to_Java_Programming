Check Point 12.10 - The File Class

12.10.1 What is wrong about creating a File object using the following statement?
        new File("c:\book\test.dat");
a- Single slash '\' is a reserved char, should use '\\' using the escape sequence 
   instead on windows  - new File("c:\\book\\test.dat")


12.10.2 How do you check whether a file already exists? How do you delete a file? How 
        do you rename a file? Can you find the file size (the number of bytes) using the 
        File class? How do you create a directory?
a-  file.exists();
    file.delete();
    file.renameTo("newFile");
    file.length();
    file.mkDirs();

12.10.3 Can you use the File class for I/O? Does creating a File object create a file on 
        the disk?
a- no
   no.
