/*
 * Exercise 11.19
 *  (Bin packing using first fit) The bin packing problem is to pack the objects of varï¿¾ious weights into containers. Assume each container can hold a maximum of 10
 *  pounds. The program uses an algorithm that places an object into the first bin in
 *  which it would fit. Your program should prompt the user to enter the total number
 *  of objects and the weight of each object. The program displays the total number
 *  of containers needed to pack the objects and the contents of each container.
 *
 *  Does this program produce an optimal solution, that is, finding the minimum
 *  number of containers to pack the objects?
 * a- It would be better to sort the object by weight befor binning them.
 *    Larger bin sizes work best.
