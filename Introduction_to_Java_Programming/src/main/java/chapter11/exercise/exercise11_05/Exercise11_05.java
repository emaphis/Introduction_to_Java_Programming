/*
 * Exercise 11.5
 *  (The Course class) Rewrite the Course class in Listing 10.6. Use an ArrayList
 *  to replace an array to store students. Draw the new UML diagram for the class.
 *  You should not change the original contract of the Course class (i.e., the defiï¿¾nition of the constructors and methods should not be changed, but the private
 *  members may be changed.)
