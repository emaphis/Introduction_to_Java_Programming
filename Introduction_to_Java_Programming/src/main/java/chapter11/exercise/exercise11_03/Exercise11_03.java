/*
 * Exercise 11.3
 *  (Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 9.7, the Account class was
 *  defined to model a bank account. An account has the properties account number,
 *  balance, annual interest rate, and date created, and methods to deposit and withï¿¾draw funds. Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts. A checking
 *  account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
 *
 *  Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program
 *  that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount and
 *  invokes their toString() methods.
