11.9.2 For the GeometricObject and Circle classes in Listings 11.1 and 11.2, answer 
the following questions:
    a. Assume that circle and object1 are created as follows:
        Circle circle = new Circle(1);
        GeometricObject object1 = new GeometricObject();
        Are the following Boolean expressions true or false?
        (circle instanceof GeometricObject)
        (object instanceof GeometricObject)
        (circle instanceof Circle)
        (object instanceof Circle)
a- true true true false     

    b. Can the following statements be compiled?
        Circle circle = new Circle(5);
        GeometricObject object = circle;
b- yes it can be compiled.

    c. Can the following statements be compiled?
        GeometricObject object = new GeometricObject();
        Circle circle = (Circle)object;
c- Yes. but it will fail at runtime.


11.9.3 Suppose Fruit, Apple, Orange, GoldenDelicious, and McIntosh are defined

       Fruit invoke this method? Can orange invoke this method?  no and no
    j. Suppose the method makeOrangeJuice is defined in the Orange class. Can 
       orange invoke this method? Can Fruit invoke this method?  no
