   Overriding is method with same name in a subclass.

11.5.3 If a method in a subclass has the same signature as a method in its superclass with 
       the same return type, is the method overridden or overloaded?
a- overridden.

11.5.4 If a method in a subclass has the same signature as a method in its superclass with 
       a different return type, will this be a problem?
a- Yes. Return type must be compatible.

11.5.5 If a method in a subclass has the same name as a method in its superclass with
       different parameter types, is the method overridden or overloaded?
a- overloaded

11.5.6 What is the benefit of using the @Override annotation?
