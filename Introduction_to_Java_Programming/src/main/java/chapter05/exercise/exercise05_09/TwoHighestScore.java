/*
 * Exercise 5.9
 *  (Find the two highest scores) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 *  number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the
 *  student with the highest score and the student with the second-highest score. Use
 *  the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name rather than using the
 *  nextLine() method. Assume that the number of students is at least 2.
