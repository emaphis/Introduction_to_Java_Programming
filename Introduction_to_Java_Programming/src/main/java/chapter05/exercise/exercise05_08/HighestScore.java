 * Exercise 5.8
 *  Find the highest score) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the num-
 *  ber of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the name
 *  of the student with the highest score. Use the next() method in the Scanner
 *  class to read a name, rather than using the nextLine() method. Assume that the
 *  number of students is at least 1.
