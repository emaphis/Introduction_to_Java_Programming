 * Exercise 5.7
 *  (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose the tuition for a univer-
 *  sity is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition will
 *  be $10,500. Write a program that displays the tuition in 10 years, and the total
 *  cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition starting after the tenth year.
 *  Based on Listing 5.10
