/*
 * Exercise 3.29
 *  (Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center
 *  coordinates and radii of two circles and determines whether the second circle
 *  is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in Figure 3.10. (Hint: cir-
 *  cle2 is inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 = r1 âˆ’ r2
 *  and circle2 overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 =
 *  r1 + r2. Test your program to cover all cases.)
